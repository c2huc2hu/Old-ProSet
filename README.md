ProSet
======

Instructions
------------
For the graphics version (proset.py), you will need pygame http://www.pygame.org/news.html (for 32-bit) or 
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame (for 64-bit). 

The cards correspond to qwer (top row) and asd (bottom row). Use those keys to select them. Use enter to submit a set.
space displays a valid set. 

History
-------
We were struck by inspiration at QCSYS 2014 and decided to play Proset, but we didn't have a deck, hence this. 

TODO
----
- Implement mouse input
- Make it stop crashing if the window loses focus (possibly a result of implementing mouse input)
- Make it more idiot proof (sanitize input)
- Port to not python.
