ProSet
======

=Instructions=
For the graphics version (proset.py), you will need pygame http://www.pygame.org/news.html (for 32-bit) or 
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame (for 64-bit). 
If cards 1, 4 and 7 make a set, type "147" into the console (without quotes). The UI uses a one-based array. 

=History=
We were bored at QCSYS 2014 and decided to play Proset, but we didn't have a deck, hence this. 

=TODO=
- Implement mouse input
- Make it stop crashing if the window loses focus (possibly a result of implementing mouse input)
- Make it more idiot proof (sanitize input)
- Port to not python.
